    Below is a semantically marked-up HTML fragment
    that tells machine clients "this is a book".

    To demonstrate the ease of creating HTML5 microdata,
    this example has been taken directly from http://schema.org/Book.
  -->
  <div id="book" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Book">

    <span itemprop="name">The Catcher in the Rye</span> -
    <link itemprop="bookFormat" href="http://schema.org/Paperback">Mass Market Paperback
    by <a itemprop="author" href="#salinger">J.D. Salinger</a>

    <div itemprop="aggregateRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/AggregateRating">
      <span itemprop="ratingValue">4</span> stars -
      <span itemprop="reviewCount">3077</span> reviews
    </div>

    <div itemprop="offers priceOffers" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Offer http://schema.org/Intangible">
      Price: <span itemprop="price">$6.99</span>
      <meta itemprop="priceCurrency" content="USD" />
      <link itemprop="availability" href="http://schema.org/InStock">In Stock
    </div>

    <!--
      The iframe below will generate the distributed affordance,
      based on the semantic markup above and the user's preferences.
      For now, those preferences are a list of service descriptions.

      It's crucial to note that the distributed affordance provider
      (in this case vyperlinks.org, but ultimately the browser or an extension)
      has never heard of the book "The Catcher in the Rye" or this page.
      It only knows that it has services that operate on books.
      These descriptions are then "instantiated" to make the links
      directly point to a page that concerns the book.
      For instance, the "Buy on Amazon" link goes directly to the book page,
      instead of simply to the Amazon home page or search page.

    <!--
      The current solution is "affordance as a service",
      because it requires a centralized provider (vyperlinks.org)
      to generate the distributed affordance.
      However, in the future, we want to decentralize this
      and let the browser itself create the affordance.
      Instead of the iframe, we would then have something similar to:

        <affordance for="book" />

      The browser would then similarly create affordance for the element #book.
